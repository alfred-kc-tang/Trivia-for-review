# Trivia

This Trivia web app had been built with its frontend using React, but its API experience had been limited. My job was to implement and test the API for this application that has the following functionalities:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. The question, category, difficulty rating are shown by default, and the answer can be shown or hidden. 
2) Add questions.
3) Delete questions.
4) Search for questions.
5) Play the quiz game, with randomized questions from either all questions or within a specific category.

# Installation

## Frontend

### Installing Dependencies

This project depends on Node.js and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```

## Backend

### Installing Dependencies


1. First install dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Then restore a database using the trivia.psql file given. With Postgres running, run the following in terminal:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

3. To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

# API Reference

## Introduction
* Base URL: This app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. The frondend is hosted at the port `3000`.
* Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

## Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format

```bash
{
    "sucess": False,
    "error": 400,
    "message": "Bad Request"
}
```

The API will return four error types when requests fail:

* 400: Bad Request
* 404: Resource Not Found
* 422: Not Processable
* 500: Internal Server Error
